Dog Breed Classification using CNN-Base Model.ipynb
- Has the base model implementation

Dog Breed Identification (Kaggle)-Using Pretrained ResNet-50 and 3 additional hidden layers.ipynb
- Has the Intermediate Implemenatation
- Requires pretrained models to be installed in the Keras modules to work.
- Floydhub.com had the pretrained modules preinstalled with the weights.

Dog Breed Identification (Kaggle)-Using Pretrained ResNet-50 and 5 additional hidden layers.ipynb
- Has the Final Code
- Requires pretrained models to be installed in the Keras modules to work.
- Floydhub.com had the pretrained modules preinstalled with the weights.

The Abstract idea to use the pretrained models was introduced by the the author
